# Neural-SLAM
Applying Active Neural SLAM algorithm for habitat simulation 

This Project will include applying Active SLAM using Reinforcement Learning Using the code from [devendrachaplot/Neural-SLAM](https://github.com/devendrachaplot/Neural-SLAM) repository
The main model will have three main parts as done in "https://github.com/devendrachaplot/Neural-SLAM"
