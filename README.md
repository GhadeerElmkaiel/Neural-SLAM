# Neural-SLAM
Training Active Neural SLAM algorithm on habitat-lab in order to use it on real robots. The desired results considered a model which is able of navigating and exploring new environments safely and while creating a map of the environment. 

This Project will include applying Active SLAM using Reinforcement Learning Using the code from [devendrachaplot/Neural-SLAM](https://github.com/devendrachaplot/Neural-SLAM) repository.
The main model will have three main parts as done in "https://github.com/devendrachaplot/Neural-SLAM"
